1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:03,294
The enemy made a breakthrough.

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,465
They took %a %n and installed it
using %a %n.

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,636
They're deploying it in datacenters,
doing %n with %n.

4
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:17,371
In the east, they developed
%n, %n and %a %n.

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,021
If Steiner deploys faster,
everything will be alright.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,234
Mein Fuhrer...

7
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:29,362
Steiner...

8
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,533
Steiner didn't have enough %n.

9
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:36,661
The deployment didn't take place.

10
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:58,697
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

11
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:18,541
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

12
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:23,233
How dare you
ignore my orders?

13
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,925
Is this what it came to?

14
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,703
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

15
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:40,437
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

16
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,044
I don't allow that...

17
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:48,258
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.

18
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:52,429
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,557
No sense of honour.

20
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,249
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

21
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,898
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,591
For years, the military
obstructed me.

23
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:13,283
All you ever did is
thwart me.

24
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,176
I should have had...

25
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:22,390
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

26
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,727
I never went to the academy.

27
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:36,505
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

28
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,864
Traitors.

29
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:48,078
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

30
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,292
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

31
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:59,548
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

32
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,600
They will drown
in their own blood.

33
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,771
Calm, Gerda.

34
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,978
All my orders have
been ignored.

35
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:23,713
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

36
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,574
It's over.

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,638
The war is lost.

38
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,310
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

39
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:49,002
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

40
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,932
Do what you want.
